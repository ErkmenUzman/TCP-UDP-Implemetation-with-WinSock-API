# TCP-UDP-Implemetation-with-WinSock-API
This project features a cross-platform chat application built with .NET and NetCoreServer, utilizing a custom TCP/UDP-based protocol. Currently, the system operates via a TCP client-server architecture where the ChatApp manages server-side logic. Future updates will expand the core networking capabilities to include a standalone TCP server and full UDP integration.

Repository for the ChatApp can be find in the following link: https://github.com/ErkmenUzman/TCP-Simple-Chat-App-Using-.NET-and-NetCoreServer
